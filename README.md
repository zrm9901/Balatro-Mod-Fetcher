# Balatro-Mod-Fetcher
A short, bundled jar file that imports mods for belatro, and can search subfolders.

(You will need to have run the game at least once and have java installed)

simply create a file called mods.txt in the directory that holds your jar file, then run it in the command line with java -jar clone1-1.jar

Example mods.txt: <br>
https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded <br>
https://github.com/MathIsFun0/Talisman <br>
https://github.com/MathIsFun0/Cryptid <br>
https://github.com/SDM0/SDM_0-s-Stuff <br>
https://github.com/larswijn/CardSleeves <br>
https://github.com/Eremel/Galdur <br>
https://github.com/SleepyG11/HandyBalatro <br>
https://github.com/jenwalter666/JensBalatroCollection <br>
https://github.com/betmma/my_balatro_mods

Warning, some of betmma's mods are incompatible with jensmodcollection, you will need to manually get rid of Betmmas_abilities and betmmas_spells

If you want support for your os, give me your mods path and platform (and preferably store) so I can add it

If you want to compile it yourself, you need to have vscode installed, download the source, then unzip it and open the folder in vscode, you then can either run the App.java file in src or run "mvn clean package" to build the project, the compiled jar will be in target
